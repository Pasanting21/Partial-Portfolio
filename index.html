        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Gennilo Dave G. Pasanting, 17 years old, born on November 3, 2008. I’m into volleyball, gaming, and
            pretty much anything that keeps me physically active. I also enjoy drawing, playing the guitar, and
            singing—even if I’m not that great at it, I still have fun doing it. I used to be really into coding,
            especially back in Grade 11 when it first caught my interest, but now that I’m in Grade 12, the passion’s
            faded a bit. Still, I like to explore different things and just go with whatever keeps life interesting.</p>
